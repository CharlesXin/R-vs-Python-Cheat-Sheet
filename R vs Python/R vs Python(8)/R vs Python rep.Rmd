`rep` in R is a very useful utility function when doing simulations. Here we indroduce how to use it and its counterpart in Python. 


```{r}
#repeat entire x 2 times
rep(x = c(1,2,3), times = 2)
#repeat entire x till the length of the new object is 10
rep(x = c(1,2,3), length.out = 10)
#repeat each element in x 2 times
rep(x = c(1,2,3), each = 2)
#repeat each element in x 2 times to get y, then repeat entire y 2 times
rep(x = c(1,2,3), times = 2, each = 2)
```

Its functionality is implemented into 2 functions: `np.tile` and `np.repeat`.
```{python, engine.path="/Users/lawrence/anaconda/bin/python"}
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1,2,3])
#repeat entire x 2 times
print np.tile(x,2)
#repeat each element in x 2 times
print np.repeat(x, 2)
#repeat each element in x 2 times to get y, then repeat entire y 2 times
print np.tile(np.repeat(x, 2),2)
```
