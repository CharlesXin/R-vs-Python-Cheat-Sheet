## We believe two languages can be killed with one stone!

Class is an important concept in Object-Oriented Programming, both R and Python are OOP language. We use class in R and type in Python to check an object's class.

#### In R
```{r cars}
library(tibble)
class(iris)
iris.tb <- as_tibble(iris)
class(iris.tb)
```

Class is not a mutually exlusive concept in R, which means one object could have more than 1 class. Here iris.tb has 3 classes.

#### In Python
```{python, engine.path="/Users/lawrence/anaconda/bin/python"}
import pandas as pd
iris = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv')
#The class of iris is DataFrame
print type(iris)
```
