Factor is a important data structure in R. Many functions takes factor differently from character and numeric. It seems like a character but is stored as numeric internally. We will show the difference between R and Python.

####In R
```{r}
#create a numeric vector
b <- rep(c("a", "b", "c"), length.out = 9)
#covnert b to a factor
factor.b <- as.factor(b)

a <- 1:9
factor.a <- cut(a, breaks = c(0,3,6,9), include.lowest = TRUE)
factor.a

#the mode of factor.a is numeric 
mode(factor.a)
#we can convert factor to numeric
as.numeric(factor.a)

```


####In Python
Python has something similar to factor, which is category.
```{python,engine.path="/Users/lawrence/anaconda/bin/python"}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
#create a pandas series of type character
b = pd.Series(np.tile(["a", "b", "c"], 3))
#convert b to a category
print b, '\n'
b_cat = b.astype("category")
print b_cat, '\n'

#create a pandas series of type int
a = pd.Series(xrange(1,10))
#cut a into 3 categories
print pd.cut(a, bins=[0,3,6,10]), '\n'
#pandas category can be converted back to a string, but can't be converted to int
print b.astype("string")
```
